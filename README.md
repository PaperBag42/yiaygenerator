# The YIAY Generator

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3b14d39227e64bca8065d0dacd2e91bd)](https://app.codacy.com/app/PaperBag42/yiaygenerator?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=PaperBag42/yiaygenerator&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

The website that automatically generates a fresh new episode in Jacksfilms' YIAY series, is almost complete!
(I'm gonna finish it, I promise)

## The Plan
1.  You enter the website.
2.  You type in a question and a twitter hashtag.
3.  You press enter.
4.  Forehead shaped loading bar.
5.  You get a video of Jack reading the top Twitter comments.
6.  I get first place on the next Jack's Challenge.

### Q&A

#### Why do you love Jack so much?

I don't. I actually kinda hate him.
I get a panic attack every time I write anything on the internet
because of this guy. But you know what I do love? Coding, of course :3

#### Why Watson Developer Cloud?

I actually went to a meetup of theirs a while ago
and they gave us an explanation about how to use their API,
as well as some free pizza and promo codes. So yeah, I'm basically sponsored.

#### Are you really going to finish this project?

You bet your ass I ain't : ^) but we'll see how far I get.
