# The YIAY Generator
My experience tells me to stop writing readme's
before finishing the project.

**But FUCK THAT, I'M TOO HYPED**

## The Plan
1. You enter the website.
2. You type in a question and a tweeter hashtag.
3. You press enter.
4. Forehead shaped loading bar.
5. You get a video of Jack reading the top twitter comments.
6. I get first place on the next Jack's Challenge.

### Q&A
**Why do you love Jack so much?**

I don't. I actually kinda hate him.
I get a panic attack every time I write anything on the internet
because of this guy. But you know what I do love? Coding, of course :3

**Why Watson Developer Cloud?**

I actually went to a meetup of theirs a while ago
and they gave us an explanation about how to use their API,
as well as some free pizza and promo codes. So yeah, I'm sold.

**Are you really going to finish this project?**

You bet your ass I ain't : ^) but we'll see how far I get.
